# Netflix Content Classification with Random Forest

## Overview

This project applies a Random Forest model to classify content on Netflix as either TV Show or Movie. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and undergoes thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing before modeling.

## Dataset

- Source: [Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows/code)
  
- Attributes: Includes details such as title, type, release year, duration, listed genres, and more.

## Project Workflow

1. Data Understanding
   - Load dataset
   - Check dataset structure & missing values
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2. Data Preparation
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Feature selection

3. Modeling
   - Train a Random Forest Classifier
   - Tune hyperparameters
   - Evaluate model performance

4. Evaluation & Interpretation
   - Check accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   - Analyze feature importance
  
## Result
- The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Important features influencing classification are identified.
